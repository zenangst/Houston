# Houston

There is a longstanding annoying bug in our beloved operating system macOS. If you open an application while Mission Control is active, the application window will cover parts of the screen, and Mission Control will simply ignore the new addition. This is where Houston comes in. 

So when a new application is added to the window manager while Mission Control is active, it will try its very best to get Mission Control to dismiss and reinitialize immediately to reorganize your windows, simply put, the way God intended.

**Notice**

This is super beta, heck the application doesn't even have a menu bar icon so you'll have to manually kill the application using the Terminal.

Special shout-out to @sindrenm, this is for you my man! ❤️
